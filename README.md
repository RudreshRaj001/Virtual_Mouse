# Virtual_Mouse 
Project Objectives:
- Develop an AI virtual mouse system that utilizes computer vision and machine learning algorithms to control the computer mouse cursor and perform scroll functions without the need for a physical mouse.
- Overcome limitations of traditional mouse devices, such as the requirement of batteries and dongles, by employing a webcam or built-in camera for hand gesture and hand tip detection.
- Enable users to control the graphical user interface (GUI) on a computer platform through hand gestures captured by the camera, eliminating the need for physical contact with devices.
- Utilize Python programming language, along with OpenCV for computer vision, MediaPipe for hand tracking, and Pynput, Autopy, and PyAutoGUI for cursor operations and scrolling functions.
- Achieve high accuracy and performance with the proposed model, making it suitable for real-world applications even on CPUs without the need for a GPU.

Problem Statement:
- Address the challenges faced in situations where physical mouse usage is impractical or restricted, such as limited space or individuals with hand impairments.
- Provide a solution for safe interaction with computer devices during situations like the COVID-19 pandemic, where touching devices may pose health risks.
- Utilize hand gesture and hand tip detection through a webcam or built-in camera to control PC mouse functions, ensuring a touchless and convenient user experience.
